					<p>Hi everyone ! My name is Diego Leon and I am an engineer in computer systems graduated at IPN-ESCOM, currently I am working as a Salesforce developer consultant. I am from Mexico city, I have lived here since I was born (1993) and believe me, Mexico city is pure magic.</p>
					<p>I started to look for a job when I was in my first year at the university, I took that decisition because I wanted to learn even more than what actually the university was teaching me. So I started to learn how to code with Java, I had my first interview for an internship close to the "Glorieta del Ã¡ngel de la independencia" and they gave me the chance to learn from them, I learned a lot, I learned how to work with threads, learned how to sync threads, how to create web services, I learned what you must know after you finish your career.</p>
					<p>Thanks to my work and my effort I obtained a lot of skills that helped me to finish my career, almost without problems, nothing is easy. As I was passing exams the university was getting harder so I got to quit my job.</p>
					<p>After that, when I was close to finish my career, I started to look for a job, again, and that is how I become a Salesforce developer consultant, found a job where they showed me what Salesforce is and I started to study about it, months later I got certified.</p>
